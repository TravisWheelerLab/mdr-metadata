The data contains trajectory from the molecular dynamics simulations of Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) protein with small molecule ligands.

All-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed with GROMACS v2024 (4) with the CHARMM36 force field (July 2020 version). The CHARMM36 forcefield parameters for ligand were obtained using the Swissparam program. The protein was placed in a periodic dodecahedron box, as implemented in GROMACS, solvated using TIP3P water molecules, and neutralized with Na+/Cl− ions at a concentration of 150 mM.  A constant pH of 7 was used in the simulations. The residues were protonated based on the pKa values obtained from propKa.

To optimize the systems' geometry before the simulation, we minimized energy using the steepest descent algorithm for 5000 steps. Subsequently, we conducted an equilibration run for 1 ns with position restraining the heavy atoms of proteins using a harmonic potential with a force constant of 1000 kJ/mol/nm2. It allows the water molecules to equilibrate around the protein. This was followed by another equilibration run for 10 ns where the heavy atom restraints were released. This was followed by production run in an isothermal-isobaric thermodynamic ensemble (NPT) for 500 ns. The production molecular dynamics simulations were conducted in four replicates using a different seed for the random starting velocities assigned from a Boltzmann distribution. The velocities for the particles in the production run were assigned from the equilibration simulations. The periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions. 
Each 500 ns replicate ran with a time step of 2 fs and atomic coordinates were saved every 10 ps. Covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained using the LINCS algorithm in all the simulations. Long-range electrostatic interactions were managed using the Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) method. The PME grid dimension was 0.12 nm with cubic interpolation. The van der Waals' and electrostatic cutoff was set at 1.0 nm.  A long-range dispersion correction for Energy and Pressure was added to the van der Waal's energies."""
